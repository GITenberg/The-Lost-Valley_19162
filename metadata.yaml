description: I came upon the place quite unexpectedly. Centuries of wind and wave
  had carved a little nook out of the foot of the cliff and fashioned it so cunningly
  that I did not see it until I was right on top of it. After the warmth of the open
  beach and the glare of the white road I had recently travelled, its shade looked
  so inviting that I limped in under the overhang of the cliff and dropped joyfully
  on to the cool patch of sand. It was the first moment of contentment I had known
  for many weary months, and, needless to say, I set myself out to make the most of
  it. I was absolutely sick of tramping about. My left boot had burst and, by the
  feel of it, there wasn't too much left of my right sole. I had been crawling along
  the road since daylight - and for many days before, for that matter - searching
  for a job that failed to materialise. Jobs, it appeared, were just about as scarce
  as cool spots in Hades. They had been very kind to me at the last farmhouse. The
  good lady had given me an excellent breakfast and an extra glass of milk, had loaded
  my bedraggled pockets with food and had finally put me on the road to the sea. Work,
  she said, they could not give me. They had put off two men the previous day.
